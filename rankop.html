                <h2> What is an Operator</h2>

                <p> One of the reasons why Rainbow has been such a popular game for so many years is because of these Operators.
                     With a multitude of over 40 Operators available,
                     each with a unique specialty, the game is entertaining because of them. Operators are divided into two camps:
                      attackers and defenders. 
                     For this reason,
                      in this page the 5 best attackers and 5 best defenders for a lineup will be displayed.   </p>
